# Weather Data Analysis

# Overview:
This project involves analyzing a time-series weather dataset using Python and basic statistical methods. The dataset provides hourly weather information from a specific location, including temperature, dew point, humidity, wind speed, visibility, atmospheric pressure, and weather conditions. The aim of this analysis is to extract valuable insights and trends from the weather data.

# Dataset:
The dataset consists of 8,784 rows and 8 columns, with the following features:

Date/Time: Timestamp of the recorded data.
Temperature (°C): The recorded temperature at each hour.
Dew Point Temperature (°C): The dew point temperature.
Relative Humidity (%): The percentage of humidity.
Wind Speed (km/h): The speed of the wind.
Visibility (km): How far one can see.
Pressure (kPa): Atmospheric pressure in kilopascals.
Weather: Describes the weather conditions (e.g., Fog, Rain, Snow).

# Key Features:
Data Loading: Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and explored its structure.
Data Cleaning: Ensured the dataset contained no missing values and renamed columns for better readability.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Found unique weather conditions.
Analyzed the frequency of specific weather conditions like Fog, Snow, and Clear.
Counted the occurrences of various wind speeds.
Computed summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and variance) for each numerical feature (e.g., Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed).

# Statistical Insights:
Identified key metrics like the mean and standard deviation for visibility, pressure, and humidity.
Determined the conditions when wind speed was exactly 4 km/h.
Extracted instances of snow and fog-related weather conditions.
Analysis Highlights
Top Weather Conditions: Identified the most common weather conditions, including "Mainly Clear," "Mostly Cloudy," and "Cloudy."
Wind Speed Trends: Explored unique wind speeds and their frequency, including identifying extreme wind speeds.
Temperature and Visibility Trends: Investigated the visibility trends over time and identified specific weather conditions where visibility exceeded 40 km.
Humidity and Pressure Variations: Explored the variance in relative humidity and standard deviation in atmospheric pressure.

# Tools Used:
Python: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing weather trends (if applicable).
Basic Statistics: Mean, standard deviation, variance, and value counts for analyzing the distribution of weather data.

# Results:
Clear identification of weather conditions affecting visibility and wind speed.
Statistical insights into the distribution of temperature, humidity, and pressure.
Frequent weather patterns such as fog and snow were highlighted.

# Conclusion:
This project provided valuable insights into the weather patterns at a specific location by leveraging Python for data analysis and basic statistics. It demonstrates how historical weather data can be used to understand trends and patterns over time.
